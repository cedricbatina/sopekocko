Hi everyone
This app is the 6th project of Openclassrooms web developer class. With this app, one has to register or sign in, in order 
to share, update, modify, delete, dislike or like sauces. The frontend has already been built with Angular
To run the frontend, please read the README file of the App's frontend. 
I am charged to create a safe API using mongoDB with user authentification and hashed password in a node.js environment using express. 
Please run npm start server on the command line to start the server and connect to the database.

Any suggestions or questions will be appreciated.
