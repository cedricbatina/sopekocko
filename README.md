Hi everyone
This app is the 6th project of Openclassrooms web developer class. With this app, one has to register or sign in, in order 
to share, update, modify, delete, dislike or like pepper sauces. The frontend has been already built. 
It was built with Angular(to run the frontend, read the README file of the App's frontend). 
I've been charged to create a secure API using mongoDB with user authentification and hashed password in a node.js environment using express 
Run npm start server on the command line to start the server and connect to the database.

For any suggestions or questions, I stay in touch:
